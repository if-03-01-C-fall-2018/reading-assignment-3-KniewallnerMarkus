	   <p>
	         A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address,[1] is a reference to a web resource that specifies its 
	   <br />location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
	   <br />
	   <br />A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many people use the two terms interchangeably.
	   <br />  
	   <br />[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), 
	   <br />database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
	   <br />
	   <br />Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. 
	         A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), 
	         a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).
	   <p>
	   <br />
	   <font size="+1" color = "blue"><u>Section about the Syntax</u></font>
	   <br />
	   <br /><strong>Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI. The URI generic syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of five components:</strong>
	   <br />
	   <br />URI = scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]
	   <br />
	   <br />
	   <br /><strong>Where the authority component divides into three subcomponents:</strong>
	   <br />
	   <br />authority = [userinfo@]host[:port]
	   <p>
	   <br />
	   <font size="+2" color = "red">Web Servers</font>
	   <br />
	   <br /> 1. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver <font size="+1" color="blue">web pages </font> 
	          to <font size="+1" color="blue">clients</font>. 
		<br />
		<br />2. While the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. 
		<br />This feature is used for submitting <font size="+1" color="blue">web forms</font>, including <font size="+1" color="blue">uploading </font>of files.
		<br />
		<br />3. Many generic web servers also support <font size="+1" color="blue">server-side scripting</font> using <font size="+1" color="blue">Active Server Pages</font> (ASP),
		<font size="+1" color="blue">PHP</font>, or other <font size="+1" color="blue">scripting languages</font>.

		<br />
		<br />A <strong>web browser</strong> (commonly referred to as a <strong>browser</strong>) is a <font size="+1" color="blue">software application</font> for accessing information on the <font size="+1" color="blue">World Wide Web</font>. Each individual <font size="+1" color="blue">web page</font>, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL, 
		      enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the <font size="+1" color="blue">user's</font> device.
		<br />
		<br />Common <font size="+1" color="blue">user interface</font>  features of browsers:
		<br/>
		<br />All major browsers allow the user to open multiple pages at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different <font size="+1" color="blue">tabs</font> of the same window. They also support the use of <font size="+1" color="blue">extensions</font> to add to or modify browser operation in a variety of ways.
		<br />
		<br />1. Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous page visited or forward to the next one.
		<br />
        <br />2. A refresh or reload button to reload the current page.
		<br/>
        <br />3. A stop button to cancel loading the page. (In some browsers, the stop button is merged with the reload button.)
		<br />
        <br />4. A home button to return to the user's home page.
		<br />
        <br />5. An address bar to input the URL of a page and display it.
		<br />
        <br />6. A search bar to input terms into a search engine. (In some browsers, the search bar is merged with the address bar

		<br />The "head" element is a container for all the head elements.The "head" element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.
		<br />
		<br />The "!DOCTYPE" declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the "html" tag.
		<br />The "!DOCTYPE" declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
		<br />
		<br />The "em" tag is a phrase tag. It renders as emphasized text.
		<br />
		<br />Differences Between HTML 4.01 and HTML5:  All layout attributes are removed in HTML5.
		<br />
		<br />The "strong" tag is a phrase tag. It defines important text.
		<br />
		<br />The "title> element"
		<br />
		<br />1. defines a title in the browser toolbar
        <br />2. provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        <br />3. displays a title for the page in search-engine results
		<br />
		<br />Definition and Usage
		<br />
		<br />1. The "html" tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
		<br />2. The "html" tag represents the root of an HTML document.
		<br />3. The "html" tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the "!DOCTYPE" tag).
